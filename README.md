## Features
* Easily and comfortably view the current playing track
* Play, pause and skip tracks without opening Spotify
* Mini-player is always on top 
* View album art and song duration
* Song/Artist/Album links to Spotify

## Notice
This is **not** a Spotify replacement. You need both running at the same time.
