Download the installer here: https://github.com/nicoskia/spotifyminiplayer/releases

**Note:** You have to "install" it, but it's simply creating a local copy of the instructions it needs to grab information from Spotify.

This application uses [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET) for all Spotify related operations.

## Features
* View the current playing track in a comfy way
* Play, pause and skip tracks without opening Spotify
* Always on top 
* View album art and song duration
* Song/Artist/Album links to Spotify

## Notice
This is **not** a Spotify replacement. You need both running at the same time.
